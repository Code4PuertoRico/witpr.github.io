Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called “channels”, and we have several set up. There are two you’ll be in by default:

- <strong>#admin-announcements</strong>: occasional announcements and messages about group governance
- <strong>#main</strong>: meet and greet; general chat

All rooms are opt-in except <strong>#admin-announcements</strong>, which is limited to admins.
