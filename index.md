		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, and we have several set up. There are two you&rsquo;ll be in by default:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li><span class="label radius">#meta:</span> occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="label radius">#hello:</span> meet and greet; general chat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except <span class="label radius">meta</span>, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p> <p><span class="label radius">TL;DR:</span> be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
