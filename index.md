		<h1>Women in Technology</h1>
		<p>The <a href="https://womenintech.slack.com">Women in Technology Slack</a> is a safe, confidential space for women in technology to chat and support each other.</p>

		<h2>How do I join?</h2>
		<p>The Slack is invitation-only, but invitations are freely granted. You can request one from any existing member or by emailing <a href="mailto:howdyrachael@gmail.com">howdyrachael@gmail.com</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>Who&rsquo;s invited?</h2>
		<p>Anybody who identifies as a woman. Male friends and allies: we appreciate your support, but this space is for us.</p>
	</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="columns">
		<h2>I want to bring a friend!</h2>
		<p>Once youâ€™re in the group, just message an admin with the email address you wish to invite, like so: <code>/admin Would you invite [[friend&rsquo;s email here]]?</code></p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, and we have several set up. There are two you&rsquo;ll be in by default:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li><span class="label radius">#meta:</span> occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="label radius">#hello:</span> meet and greet; general chat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except <span class="label radius">announcements</span>, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p> <p><span class="label radius">TL;DR:</span> be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
